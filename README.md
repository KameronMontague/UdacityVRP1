Hello this is Kameron Montague. Im not 100% sure what to put inside this file but I guess I will explain a few 
things that I changed in this project as best I can.

One of the first things I changed was the cube above the text. I was just playing around with it when I found out
that a sphere was hiding behide it. I decided it needed to be duplicated and put it on either side of the the cube.
Later on I found out that the cube had a voice so I decided to add a simple audio component to the cube object and
make it play on a loop. The purpose of this was to hear how the cube sounds differently in 3d space when it teleports
randomly from place to place when clicked. I also modified the rate of particles to make it easier to locate,
and so the user actual knows it teleported not disappeared.

So for my first button called its Raining cubes I changed the numCubes amount in the UdacityFunEffects.cs file to
100 because... CUBES! This didnt work right away because I needed to modify the number on the unity inspector. After
hitting play it was fun at first but I started to drown in cubes... so I halfed it to 50 so you guys will only half
drown in a sea of cubes. The reset button is still visable though, incase you want to dry off.

The particle color change was cool and I wanted to change the way the particles behaved. The cube particles can be compared to the
particles on the sphere(default particle settings). The new settings I added give them speed but also make them
effected by gravity to a certain degree. I also played with the rotation to make it look like the particles 
are being spat out in random locations. And the button still changes the color of the cube particles and original sphere.

The last button makes the sun god Ra leave and or enter the room based on where he was before. I played around
with the code rotation and had the sun rotate around the room a few times on one click but didnt like the effect. So
I changed the color the sun emmits so I could see the effect light from this source had on the floor. The red light
lands on the white surfaces of the floor and return back to normal when the sun sets. This is basically what would happen
if light shines on a dark location creating shadows and stuff. I just think the effects created by unity are pretty cool
when it comes to lighting.

This whole project took me about an hour of looking at all the code you provided me and messing around with settings.
Thank you for looking at my project, I hope to learn alot more as we go.
